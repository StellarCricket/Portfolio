        <p>As a Florida native, I am all about soaking up the sunshine and preparing for hurricanes. When I graduated from Santa Fe College with my A.A. in Anthropology, I had a full-time position offered to me as the manager of a portrait studio I had worked at during my time in Gainesville. There was a catch, however. I was relocated to Daytona Beach where I worked diligently for two years before the whole company closed.
                <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          
        After working in the photography industry for another two years, I retired from portraits and entered the telecommunications field. My positive disposition and work ethic took me from being a customer service representative to a team lead, a trainer, and eventually as a quality analyst, handling multiple clients and helping them to evolve and develop the quality of their customer service.
        I realized that I wanted to start learning again. I enrolled in a 24-week Data Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Central Florida to build a skill set that would be the foundation from which I would take off.
        <br>
          <br>
          <br>
     I discovered that I thrived with building datasets, ferreting out problems in code and data, building tables, and analyzing the relationships between variables. I learned that I can win any argument with a well-made story. Before the course was over, I had started planning and creating my own projects. Through the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, I finished the course and am ready to keep sharpening my skills in data analytics. I love learning and discovering new points of view, be it through other people's perspectives or analyzing sets of data. I hope to make a positive impact on the world and inspire people to be more curious.
